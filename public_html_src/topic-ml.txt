CMU:SV Sneak Peek Talk:

Deep neural networks and other state-of-the-art machine learning techniques produce opaque models
resistant to human introspection. This leads to unintended consequences such as privacy and
fairness violations: Google offered ads for high-paying executive jobs more often to men than to
women, the U.S. retailer Target inferred that a young woman was pregnant from her purchases and
inadvertently revealed this private information to her farther by offering discounts for
baby-related products. Discovering and correcting for such problematic behaviors requires novel
transparency techniques. I will give an overview of the work we are doing at CMU:SV to address
these problems and the student project options for the fall semester.
